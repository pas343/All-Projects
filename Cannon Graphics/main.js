//hint: using ArrayCamera can be tricky. You will need to set the initial camera positions and viewports, handle resize for them (note that you need to consider the device pixel ratio if dpr!=1, and an array camera's "type" is actually "PerspectiveCamera"), set the up property of sub-cameras because the default is the +y direction which is not necessarily desirable, and if you want to use the old controls for a sub camera, you need to set the control's targetwhen you switch, and manually update the camera's projection matrix in animate(). Also switching to/from array cameras would require changing the viewport(you can use resizeCanvas()). Finally you may need to set object.frustumCulled=false on *all* visible objects to avoid a disappearing problem with array cameras.

//each cannon will have a base (a box) that can rotate horizontally, and a body (a truncated cone that has a sphere in one end) that can tilt up or down. The body will be children of the base in the scene graph, so that rotation of the box applies automatically to the body. For more info on scene graphs see https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-scenegraph.html

//this example shows how to programmatically create simple shapes. More complex models should probably be designed in external software and imported.
//note that we can reuse geometries and materials, and only change the position and rotation of the object(mesh) to create multiple copies of something.

See https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-cors-permission.html about why, and https://onlinepngtools.com/convert-png-to-base64 for a tool to convert a picture to base64 encoding. The skeleton HTML file already includes a few encoded images but you can add your own. You don't have to use base64 encoding, and can also load an image normally from a server. Some public websites are configured to allow their images to be used in WebGL, and you can easily set up your local web server, for example by using Python: "python3 -m http.server" or "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" - see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server
